/* On the phone the dialog is displayed with the buttons hidden by the address bar at the bottom of the screen
   and it is impossible to scroll the page up to reveal them - typical forked up angular material UI design.
   This is supposed to make it possible to scroll the dialog up to see the buttons so they can be used. 
   It appears to work in the MS Edge emulator.
   Alas there appears to no solution for the dialog not displaying in the center of the phone screen even though
   the width of the dialog is set appropriately - instead it displays half on/half off and must be scrolled
   into view (yet more forked up angular material UI design). NB The workaround for this is to apply a
   fixed position when opening the dialog, it's the only to affect the dialog position.
