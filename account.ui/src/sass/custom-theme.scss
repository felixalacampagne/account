// This is no longer used (I hope)!
// I finally managed to figure out how to revert to a standard Material theme
// instead of this theme which is lacking the ability to give buttons color.
// The standard themes are only able to give buttons colour using the 
// supposedly deprecated 'color' attribute - I have found no alternative
// in the Material 3 way of doing things - but at least 'color' is enabled
// without needing to go hunting through generated code to find something 
// to uncomment - no clue why it forced me to have a generated theme in the first
// place, presumably because they know it will cause all sorts of headaches and
// hours of wasted time.
// Would really like to decrease the 'density' but no clue how to do it when
// overriding a value in a standard theme.

// NB. To use it again (why on earth would I????) put the path in the 'styles' section of angular.json
