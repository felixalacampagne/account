// I finally managed to figure out how to revert to a standard Material theme
// instead of this theme which is lacking the ability to give buttons color.
// The standard themes are only able to give buttons colour using the 
// supposedly deprecated 'color' attribute - I have found no alternative
// in the Material 3 way of doing things - but at least 'color' is enabled
// without needing to go hunting through generated code to find something 
// to uncomment - no clue why it forced me to have a generated theme in the first
// place, presumably because they know it will cause all sorts of headaches and
// hours of wasted time.
// Would really like to decrease the 'density' but no clue how to do it when
// overriding a value in a standard theme.

// NB. To use it again (why on earth would I????) put the path in the 'styles' section of angular.json

// Custom Theming for Angular Material
// For more information: https://material.angular.io/guide/theming
@use '@angular/material' as mat;
// Plus imports for other components in your app.

html {
   @include mat.all-component-densities(-1);
   // @include mat.input-density(-4);
   @include mat.form-field-density(-3);

// Has no effect with Angular 18. Docs only present for Angular 19   
   // @include mat.dialog-overrides((
   //    supporting-text-size: 9px,
   //    supporting-text-line-height: 60px,
   //    content-padding: 0px
   //  ));   
 }
