 Some plugin definitions which might come in handy at some time. Couldn't keep them in the pom.xml
 file because it is impossible to comment blocks which already contain comments (which Java committee
 member thought that one up??). Unfortunately the suggested use of a dummy 'processing instruction',
 ie. '<?ignore evertying including comments ?>' didn't work and for some reason CDATA doesn't work either.
 
 So only choice is to remove the entire block since the comments are vital to understanding what the fork
 the gibberish is trying to accomplish.
